const FAQS = [
  { question: "What materials do you use?", answer: "We use premium cotton and acrylic yarns sourced for their softness, colour vibrancy, and durability. Each piece is crafted with a fine steel or aluminium crochet hook depending on the detail required." },
  { question: "How long does it take to make a piece?", answer: "Depending on the complexity, a single piece can take anywhere from 2 hours (a simple keychain) to 15+ hours (a full bouquet). Each stitch is done by hand — no machines, no shortcuts." },
  { question: "Do you take custom orders?", answer: "Yes! We love bringing your ideas to life. DM us on Instagram @threadmeditation with your concept and we’ll discuss colours, size, and timeline. Custom pieces typically take 1–2 weeks." },
  { question: "How do I care for my crochet piece?", answer: "Gently hand wash in cool water with mild soap if needed, then reshape and air dry flat. Most pieces are display items and won’t need frequent washing. Keep away from direct sunlight to preserve colours." },
  { question: "Do you ship internationally?", answer: "We’re setting up shipping options and will announce availability on our Instagram. Currently, reach out via DM or our contact form to discuss shipping to your location." },
